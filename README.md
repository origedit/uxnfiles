a proof-of-concept file browser for [uxn](https://100r.co/site/uxn.html).

you can only use the mouse to navigate it.

note that the path to executables is stored within the source code

the purpose of the app was to be able to open files from within the uxn emulator. this works for roms. unfortunately, you can't just click a .tal file and have the text editor open. this is because uxn apps accept the file names from the console port, and there is no way for a uxn program to send itself messages.
